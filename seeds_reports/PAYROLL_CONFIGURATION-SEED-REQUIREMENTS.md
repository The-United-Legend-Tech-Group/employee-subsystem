## 4) Fields Without Seed Values
- `_id`, timestamps auto-generated.
- Many approval metadata fields (approvedAt) set only where shown; otherwise remain unset.

## 5) Enums & Status Coverage
- ConfigStatus: APPROVED, DRAFT, REJECTED all represented across entities.
- PolicyType: DEDUCTION, ALLOWANCE, BENEFIT used.
- Applicability: AllEmployees used.

## 6) Validation Notes
- Unique fields: payGrade.grade, allowance.name, insuranceBrackets name+range, payType.type, signingBonus.positionName, taxRules.name, terminationAndResignationBenefits.name, payrollPolicies.policyName must match exactly.
- createdBy/approvedBy reference EmployeeProfile (alice) seeded earlier; ensure employees exist first.
- PayGrade sync depends on Position records from Organization Structure.

## 7) Minimum Acceptance Checklist
- CompanyWideSettings has Africa/Cairo timezone and EGP currency.
- Four base pay grades (Junior, Senior, Mid Draft, Intern Rejected) with exact salaries/statuses, plus auto-created grades for every position title.
- Four allowances with statuses as listed.
- Five insurance bracket entries with ranges/rates/amounts exactly as shown.
